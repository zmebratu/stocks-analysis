# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project
This project was done to analyze and refractor several stocks to determine if the VBA code reduced the amount of time that the script would run.

### Results
After refractoring the VBA code, the script did run faster than the original code. In 2017, the code ran for about .5 seconds but after the changes were made, it ran for 0.20 seconds. In 2018 the script took 0.48 seconds but after refractoring, it now runs for 0.20 seconds also.

We can also see that 2017 had more positive returns that 2018. However, the only stock that was able to gain positive returns for both years was ENPH.

## Summary
The advantages of refractoring code is a quicker run time and a more specific/defined code. A disadvantage to it is the possibility of including more errors. In addition to this, its not ideal if you're in a hurry. 
In comparison to the original VBA script, we were able to cut down on the time it takes for the script to load. In addition to this, the refractored code was more understandable.
