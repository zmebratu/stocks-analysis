# stocks-analysis

##Overview of Project
This project was done to analyze and refractor several stocks to determine if the VBA code reduced the amount of time that the script would run.

##Results
After refractoring the VBA code, the script did run faster than the previous code. In 2017, the code ran for about .5 seconds but after the changes were made, it ran for 0.2 seconds. The 2018 the script took 0.48 seconds but after refractoring, it now runs for 0.19 seconds.
